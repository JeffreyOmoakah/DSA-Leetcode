# LEETCODE QUESTION & SOLUTION

This repository contains all of my LeetCode question solutions along with detailed explanations of my thought process behind each one. I solve LeetCode problems every day and use this repo to track my progress, serve as a personal reference, and provide others with a clear way to understand both brute-force and optimized approaches. 

Most solutions are written in **Python**, but I occasionally use **Java** to strengthen my backend problem-solving skills. This repository can serve as a learning resource or reference for interview preparation and structured problem-solving.
